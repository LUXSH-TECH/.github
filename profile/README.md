## 🧑‍💻 Basic Coding Standards

To ensure maintainability, consistency, and high-quality software, please follow these internal coding practices:

### 🔸 General Practices
- Write **clear, modular, and reusable code**
- Prefer **readability over cleverness**
- All files must include a short **header comment** explaining the purpose
- Follow **naming conventions** that reflect clarity and intent

### 🔸 Python Standards
- Follow **PEP8** style guide
- Use type hints: `def fetch_data(id: int) -> dict:`
- Lint code with **flake8** or **ruff**
- Format code with **black** (use `black .` before committing)
- Add meaningful **docstrings** using the Google or NumPy format

### 🔸 JavaScript/TypeScript Standards
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for consistent formatting
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use arrow functions and destructuring where appropriate
- Avoid deeply nested callbacks or logic — refactor for clarity

### 🔸 Git & Repo Hygiene
- Use **feature branches** (`feature/xyz-description`)
- Write **clear, imperative commit messages** (e.g., `Add tokenizer module for NLP pipeline`)
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use Pull Requests (PRs) with at least **one reviewer approval**
